kernel will sometimes deadlock on booting
this is caused by the calibration pic never firing
(or at least never leaving the loop that waits for it to fire)

some allocation methods are unsafe even though they are marked safe

things to check:
make a version of Once and Lazy that disables interrupts and only use that

some panics possible to trigger from userspace in memory writer

sometimes a panic with no avaialable threads occur in event_pool_await
