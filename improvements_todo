Clean up the kernel allocator api,
it is unnecassarily generic even though there will only be 1 allocator

Also improve the kernel heap allocator, it is very bad

add guard pages at the end of kernel stacks

remove all unbound and fix linked list, remove as much unsafe as possible

change to use relative call instructions instead of absolute call with register
this option is called code model
should set vma to 0xffffffff80000000, and use mcmodel kernel

document old code
run auto formatter
