Also improve the kernel heap allocator, it is very bad

improve memory mapping api to not require strong reference, not require cap to be in that same process
maybe don't have 1 mapping restriction on resize in place

add guard pages at the end of kernel stacks

remove as much unsafe as possible

bitflags for all syscall options

add support to memory mapping syscalls that allow mapping at some offset into the memory capability
extend memory_update_mapping to support moving the base address and changing mapping flags

change to use relative call instructions instead of absolute call with register
this option is called code model
should set vma to 0xffffffff80000000, and use mcmodel kernel

document old code
run auto formatter
