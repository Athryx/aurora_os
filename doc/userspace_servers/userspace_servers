Servers for userspace:

ipc_server:
provides listings of all other ipc servers, manages app permisions

user_server:
provides a way to elevate permissions or get the permissions of a certain user
this will pretty much just store the key to a set of permissions for the root and each user

ahci_server:
provides access to ahci drives, used by filesystem_server

filesystem_server:
has the filesystem

hwio_server:
pretty simple server that just stores capabilities to kernel objects used for hardware io (MmioAllocator and PortAllocator)

app_server:
launches applications and sets their initial permissions
