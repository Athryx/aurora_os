TODO:

must do:

later:
specify layout of global information table

specify atomicity of syscalls

specify more advanced mmio allocation syscalls
specify more advanced spawner syscalls

maybe copy on write memory

more advanced read syscalls

syscalls that can act on many capabilities at once by taking in an array

fast_* syscalls which will be commonly used operations that would normally be performed in multiple syscalls,
but performed in 1 syscall to reduce context switch overhead

make virtual MmioAllocator, IntAllocator, and PortAllocator for containers (not needed for a long time)

IMPLEMANTATION ISSUES:
nothing implemented


syscall abi:
rax[0-31]: syscall number
rax[32-63]: syscall options

all args are saved if they are not used by a particular syscall to return a value


options available to all syscalls, unless otherwise specified:
bit 31 (weak_auto_destroy): automatically destoy a weak capability if it is dead


syserr codes:
syserr codes that mey be returned by all syscalls:
Ok: operation completed succesfully

OutOfMem: not enough memory available to perform operation

InvlId: any syscall taking in a capability will return InvlId if the cid does not exist
these syscalls will return InvlId even if a capability of a different type than the syscall was expecting exists

InvlPerm: insufficient capability permissions
required permissions for each capability in each syscall will be listed

InvlWeak: passed in a weak capability which referenced an object that was no longer alive

Unknown: an unknown error occured
this should not happen, and it is a bug if Unknown is ever returned


common struct definitions:
struct UserArray<T> {
	data: *const T,
	len: usize,
}
len is number of elements, not bytes
data must be properly aligned for the type it is pointing to

struct UserString {
	data: UserArray<u8>,
}
must point to a valid utf-8 string

struct UserPageArray {
	addr: usize,
	len: usize,
}
addr must be page aligned
len is number of pages

CapPriv(usize)
a bitmask representing the permissions of a capability
bit 0 (cap_read): allows reading of or sending to the object referenced by this capability
bit 1 (cap_prod): allows proding the object referenced by the capability
bit 2 (cap_write): allows writing to or recieving from the object referenced by this capability
in general, operations that require cap_read read properties without altering the objects state
operations requiring cap_prod may alter internal state, but in a less privalidged and less abritrary way than write
operations requiring cap_write can alter large portions of the objects internal state
bit 3 (cap_upgrade): allows upgrading a weak capability to a strong capability

CapFlags(usize)
a bitmask representing the various properties of a capability
bit 0-3 (cap_priv): specifies the privalidges of a capability
uses bits 0-2 of the CapPriv type
bit 4 (cap_weak): capability is a weak capability
this means that the capability does not keep the underlying object alive,
and the object is deallocated when all strong capabilities are gone
bit 5-8 (cap_type): specifies what type of object the capability refers to
0: Process
represents a protection context, has a set of capabilities and a virtual address space

1: Memory
memory that can be mapped into a process

2: Event
used to signal other threads about an event

3: Channel
used for ipc, and can be used to send capabilities to other processess

4: Key
a globally unique identifier, used to authenticate actions with other servers

5: Interrupt
represents a hardware interrupt

6: Port
represents an io port that can be used from userspace

7: Spawner
gives permission to create processess and can kill processess that were spawned on it
used to prevent malicious processess from spawning other processess and not killing them, which would leak memory

8: Allocator
represents permission to allocate a certain amount of memory for use by other objects

9: RootOom
used by the kernel to inform the userspace paging process that an out of memory event has occured on the root allocator
normally a channel is used, but their are special requirements for the RootOom object,
since it cannot allocate memory from a parent allocator like a channel can

10: MmioAllocator
allows memory mapped io to be allocated

11: IntAllocator
allows interrupts to be created

12: PortAllocator
allows ports to be created

// Thread id
type tid = usize;

// Capability id
// when picking an id for a capability, the kernel ensures that the bottom 7 bits match the CapFlags that represent information about the capability
type Cap<T> = usize;

the format of the message buffer sent by the following syscalls is described bellow
word means the size of a word (64 bits on x64, not 16 bits)
word 1: length of the message, in words, including this field and all other header fields
when the message is sent, the kernel will clamp the word to ensure it is less than the maximum message length for the channel it is being sent on, and greater than the position of the last sent capability
word 2: flags
bit 0 (reply):
if this bit is set, a capability to a channel object is sent in the reply object word, and the reciever should reply with reply_recv to this channel
if this bit is not set, the reply word will be zeroed
bit 32-63 (cap_count):
the number of capabilities to send / the number that were sent
the kernel will clamp this value if it exceeds the message buffer length
if any capability does not exist, the kernel will ignore that value, and decrement the length by 1
word 3: reply
a capability to a channel object for server to reply to, zeroed if unused

after these words, there will be all the capabilities
after the capabilities, there will be all the data words
the data words continue to the end of the message

41: fn int_eoi(int: Cap<Interrupt>) -> SysErr
signals that {int} can start sending interrupts again

required capability permissions:
{int}: cap_write


42: fn port_new(allocator: Cap<Allocator>, port_allocator: Cap<PortAllocator>, port: u16) -> (err: SysErr, port: Cap<Port>)
creates a capability referencing a port object on the specified port

options:
bit 0-3 (port_cap_flags): CapPriv representing privalidges over this port

required capability permissions:
{allocator}: cap_prod
{port_allocator}: cap_prod

syserr code:
InvlArgs: port passed to port_new is reserved by the kernel
InvlOp: another capability referencing this port already exists

return value:
port: capability referencing the port


43: port_num(port: Cap<Port>) -> (err: SysErr, num: usize)
returns what io port number this port is

required capability permissions:
{port}: cap_read

return value:
num: port number


44: fn port_map(process: Cap<Process>, port: Cap<Port>) -> SysErr
allows the process to use the port referenced by {port}

required capability permissions:
{process}: cap_write
{port}: cap_write

syserr code:
InvlOp: process had already mapped port


45: fn port_unmap(process: Cap<Process>, port: Cap<Port>) -> SysErr
the process can no longer use the port referenced by {port}

required capability permissions:
{process}: cap_write
{port}: cap_write

syserr code:
InvlOp: process had not yet mapped port


46: fn spawner_new(allocator: Cap<Allocator>, spawn_key: Cap<Key>) -> (err: SysErr, spawner: Cap<Spawner>)
creates a new spawner
{spawn_key} is a key passed to userspace during boot that allows creation of spawners

options:
bit 0-3 (spawner_cap_flags): CapPriv representing privalidges over this spawner

required capability permissions:
{allocator}: cap_prod
{spawn_key}: cap_read

return value:
spawner: capability to a new spawner object


47: fn spawner_kill_all(spawner: Cap<Spawner>) -> SysErr
kills all the processes that were made with this spawner

required capability permissions:
{spawner}: cap_write


48: fn allocator_new(parent: Cap<Allocator>, max_pages: usize) -> (err: SysErr, allocator: Cap<Allocator>)
creates a new suballocator from the parent allocator that can allocate up to {max_pages} worth of memory
simply creating an allocator does not actually allocate any memory from the parent (except for the allocator object itself)
creating objects will allocate memory from the parent, and so will the allocator_prealloc syscall

when this allocator is destroyed, all objects that were previously allocated on it are now put in it's parent
the memory restrictions of the parent now apply
prealloced pages are also moved to the parent

options:
bit 0-3 (allocator_cap_flags): CapPriv representing privalidges over this allocator

required capability permissions:
{parent}: cap_prod

return value:
allocator: capability to new allocator object


49: fn allocator_capacity(allocator: Cap<Allocator>) -> (err: SysErr, used: usize, prealloced: usize, free: usize)
returns how much used and free memory is left in the allocator

required capability permissions:
{allocator}: cap_read

return value:
used: amount of used memory in {allocator}
prealloced: amount of prealloced memory in {allocator}
free: amount of free memory (excludes preallocated memory) in {allocator}


50: fn allocator_prealloc(allocator: Cap<Allocator>, pages: usize) -> SysErr
preallocate at least {pages} pages of memory from parent allocator
if there is not enough memory left in this allocator, an oom event on this allocator will be triggered, unless prealloc_truncate is used
even if this allocator has enough space to allocate all the pages, an oom event could still be generated in a parent if there is not enough space

options:
bit 0 (prealloc_truncate): if the preallocation would exceed the allocator's maximum allowed size,
it will be truncated, and will fill all of the remaining size without generating an oom error
bit 1 (prealloc_amount): prealloc will allocate enough memory so that there are {pages} un allocated pages in this allocator
bit 2 (prealloc_set_regrow): will set the amount of pages this allocator will get from it's parents when it runs out of memory
options prealloc_truncate and prealloc_amount are ignored in this mode

required capability permissions:
{allocator}: cap_prod


// TODO: specify oom event fromat, and when InvlArgs is thrown because insufficient channel size
51: fn allocator_bind_oom_handler(allocator: Cap<Allocator>, channel: Cap<Channel>) -> SysErr
bind a channel to recieve oom events from the allocator
if another oom channel was registered, that one will no longer recieve oom events

required capability permissions:
{allocator}: cap_write
{channel}: cap_prod


52: fn allocator_set_max_pages(allocator: Cap<Allocator>, pages: isize) -> SysErr
sets the maximum number of pages the allocator can allocate

options:
bit 0 (set_max_relative): will add {pages} to the current max value, instead of setting the max value

required capability permissions:
{allocator}: cap_write

syserr code:
InvlArgs: attempted to set max size to a value less than the currently allocated space (excluding prealloceted memory),
or attempted to set max size to a negative value


// TODO: this syscall assumes that no iommu is in place to restrict dma
// if one is in place, the thread will need an alternative method of sending date to the specified address
53: fn root_oom_listen(root_oom: Cap<RootOom>) -> (SysErr, page_out: bool)
blocks the thread until an oom event occurs on the root allocator

if page_out == true, the kernel is requesting that memory be paged out to disk
the root oom table will have values set to indicate which physical regions of memory should be paged out to disk
these regions must be paged out to disk, and the root allocator will assume they are paged out to disk
if for whatever region these memory regions can't be paged out to disk, the thread must call root_oom_panic
once the thread pages them out to disk, it should set the disk sector field to the disk sector they were paged out to
(really any unique id is ok, but disk sector is the most conveniant because using another id would require a map, which may require some form of allocation)

the thread that pages these values out to disk should not ever allocate memory from the kernel

the format of the root oom table is described bellow
word 0: number of entries
word 1: unused
word 2: disk sector
word 3: physical memory address (alway page aligned)
word 4: size of zone in pages
words 2, 3, and 4 are repeated the amount of times specified in word 0

if page_out == false, the kernel is requesting that data be retrieved from disk and put back into memory
data should be retrieved from disk according to the disk sector field, and should be put back into memory at the specified physical address

only 1 thread can wait on {root_oom} at a time

required capability permissions:
// usually a client side read of a communication object would be cap_prod,
// but in this case the thread must have the option of calling root_oom_panic, which has cap_write permissions
{root_oom}: cap_write

syserr code:
InvlOp: another thread is already waiting on {root_oom}


54: fn root_oom_panic(root_oom: Cap<RootOom>) -> SysErr
indicates that the requested physical memory zones cannot be paged out to disk, and panics the kernel

required capability permissions:
{root_oom}: cap_write
